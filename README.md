# Python Game Project

## Getting Started

1. Create a repository with this template to the class GitHub with you and your partner's name in the title, e.g., `connect4-alice-bob`.
   - If the repository is not in the class GitHub, you will not receive credit for the project.
2. Add your partner as a collaborator to the repository.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.

## Introduction

This project is simple: make a graphical game using Python.

You can use PyQt, `tkinter`, `pygame`, etc., but you must use Python. Even though we haven't gone over PyGame in class yet, I believe that you all have the skills to learn it on your own. Additionally, you will be allowed to work in pairs on this project (maximum of 2 people per group).

REMINDER: this project is a game of you and your partner's own creation. You are not remaking a game that is already popular like connect four, tic-tac-toe, or snake. You are creating a game that is unique to you and your partner.

## Requirements

### README

Modify ***THIS*** README document to include the following information for the user of the game:

- Game Title at top of README

- How to install the game
- How to run the game
- How to play the game
  - The objective of the game
  - The rules of the game
  - The controls for the game
  - How to win the game
- Any additional information that the user may need to know

### Game Design Document (Due Wednesday, May 15 at 11:59 PM)

You must come up with a game concept and design. This includes the game's objective, rules, and mechanics. This document should include the following:

- Game Title
- Game Objective
- Game Rules
- Game Mechanics
- Game Controls
- Game Assets (e.g., images, sounds, etc.)
- Game Screens (e.g., main menu, game screen, game over screen, etc.)
- Game Flowchart/Storyline (i.e., how the game progresses)

You must submit the design document as `DESIGN.md` in your repository.

### The Game Itself (Due Tuesday, May 21 at 11:59 PM)

1. Core Gameplay Mechanics
   - Player Movement/Input
     - Responsive player controls with keyboard/mouse input
   - Scoring System
     - A scoring system that tracks player progress
   - Game Over Condition
     - A game over condition that ends the game
   - Game States (e.g., main menu, game screen, game over screen, etc.)
     - Different game states that transition based on player actions

2. Graphics and Visual Elements
   - Use of Sprites
     - Use of sprites for player, enemies, and other game objects
   - Use of Backgrounds
       - Use of backgrounds to create a visually appealing game
   - Use of Fonts
     - Use of fonts to display text in the game
   - Use of Sound Effects
     - Use of sound effects to enhance the game experience
   - Use of images and sounds that are not copyrighted
     - You must create your own images and sounds or use images and sounds that are in the public domain (e.g., OpenGameArt.org)
     - You must provide credit to the original creator of any images or sounds that you use in your game
3. Use of Object-oriented Programming
   - Use of classes and objects to organize game code
   - Use of inheritance and polymorphism to create reusable code
   - Use of encapsulation for private data and methods
4. Multiple Files and Modularity
   - Use of multiple files to organize game code
   - Use of modules to create reusable code
5. Documentation and Comments
   - Use of comments to explain code
   - Use of docstrings to document functions and classes
   - Use of README.md file to explain how to run the game
6. Error Handling
   - Use of error handling to prevent crashes
   - Use of try/except blocks to catch exceptions

***NOTE:*** You and your partner's game does not need to be complicated. It can be simple so long as it implements the core gameplay mechanics and requirements listed above.

## Note on Commits

You must commit your code to the GitHub repository to receive credit for the assignment. At the end of your project, **EACH** person in the pair must have at least 10 commits. Failure to meet this requirement will result in a deduction of points. This means at least a total of 20 commits.

### Commit Check-in Dates

I will be checking your progress on the following dates:

- Thursday, May 9
- Monday, May 13
- Wednesday, May 15
- Monday, May 20

You must have a commit on or before each of these dates to receive full credit for the project, unless you are completing the project early. I will be checking each person's commits on these dates.

### Having Two People in a Group

If you are working in a group of two, you must both contribute to the project. This means that you must both be actively coding and committing to the repository. If I see that one person is doing all the work, I will deduct points from the person who is not contributing.
